# Session Log

Newest entry at the top. One entry per working session or before a compaction.
Keep entries short: what was done, what was verified, what is next.

Template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>
- Done: <task IDs and one-line outcome>
- Verified: <commands run / device checks>
- Decisions: <D-xxx added, if any>
- Next: <task ID>
- Notes: <anything the next session must know>
```

## 2026-10-13 — Project docs and trackers
- Done: Created `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/spec.md`, `docs/design.md`, `docs/plan.md`, and
  trackers (`STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`).
- Verified: n/a (documentation only).
- Decisions: D-001 to D-006.
- Next: T0.1 — scaffold the Gradle project.
- Notes: Scope confirmed with user (status saver, Compose, minSdk 26). Code work
  should use the `programming-as-theory-building` skill; program theory lives in
  `docs/design.md` §1.
